## Motivation and Idea

With the expansion of hotel scales, traditional bookkeeping methods are no longer able to meet the demands of modern operations.
There's a pressing need for a more digitized and information-centric approach. 
The requirements for a hotel management system are distinct, and its database design can serve as a benchmark in the industry.
